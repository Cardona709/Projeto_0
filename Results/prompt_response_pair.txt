Prompt:

            You are a network engineer responsible for analyzing the feed you received from a drone and identify the needs of the users in the network.
            The image was pre-processed to identify the objects in the image and their coordinates. 
            Your role here is to analyze the detected objects and infer the needs of the users in the network. The output must be the throughput need per user in the network.
            For example, if a object or a group of objects are near a fire, one can infer that those users need a more reliable connection and might need to be prioritized and more probably need to transmit heavy data, such as streaming a video or an image.
            If the user in question does not appear to be in a througput demainding situation, then the user can be classified as low or medium throughput need, and the justification for this classification can be just a simple sentence, like "the user is not in a througput demanding situation" or "the user is not in a fire situation".
            Also you are given a .txt file under the name "object_coordinates.txt" that contains the coordinates of the objects detected in the image, which are also present in the image.
            The output must be a JSON object with the following schema, this must be replicated for each user in the image:
